Welcome to this word game called - "GUESS THE WAY".
This is a simple word game based on python rules and condtions.

Game Syntax:

1. Player Setup (Name and Age)
2. Game Setup (Start the game)
3. Stage Setup (Random Stages)
4. Points Update (Based on stage clearance)
5. Game End (End of game, Score and round tally)

I used import, function, input, print, while and nested loops to create a simple puzzle game.

imports = Random Module for random stage setup and random answer
input = for name,age, answers for each stage
functions = for stages (hill,jungle,lake,river)
loops = Nested loop for gameplay
